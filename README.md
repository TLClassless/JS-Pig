A game I coded as a part of a course in Javascript.

GAME RULES:

ğŸ‘‰ The game has 2 players who take it in turn to play.

ğŸ‘‰ On each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their round score.

ğŸ‘‰ BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his round score gets lost. After that, it's over to the next player.

ğŸ‘‰ The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their round score gets added to their global score. Then, it's back to the other player. 

ğŸ‘‰ The first player to reach 100 points on their global score is declared winner of the game! ğŸ‘‘
